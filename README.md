# Ajax
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. AJAX is not a programming language. AJAX just uses a combination of: A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server) JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

# AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

- Update a web page without reloading the page
- Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Send data to a server - in the background
